## Project Brief
Horiseon (a SEO focused marketing agency) has requested updates to the HTML and CSS files for their landing page.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Changes Made
Changed HTML elements to semantic naming conventions. 
Updated CSS to use corresponding names where class was not present.
Added alt text to images.
Put heading attributes in seqential order.
Added a title.
